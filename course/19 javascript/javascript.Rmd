# JavaScript

## JavaScript

- has nothing to do with Java
- makes the internet slow despite broadband connections
- runs in your browser
- poses a hurdle to webscraping because often, the information you want is generated by JavaScript 
- R (of cause) has no native way of evaluating JavaScript but browser engines have and we can use those

## JavaScript

- Live Clicking
- Live Developer Tools

`document.write("You did not see this coming right!?")`
