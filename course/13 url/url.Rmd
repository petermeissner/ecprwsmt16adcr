**URL example**

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile=default&search=bruce&fulltext=Search

## URL scheme

**`scheme://domain`**`:port/`**`path?query_string`**`#fragment_id`

- scheme: which protocoll to use
- domain and port: which *server* to contact
- path: path to the resource 
- query_string: which parameters to use
- fragment_id: to which part of the resource to jump to


## URL encode and decode

- URLs are ASCII only and even things like spaces are not allowed
- therfore one need to en- and de-code URL before using them

```{r}
URLencode("http://mypage.com/my super cool #tag")
URLdecode("http://mypage.com/my%20super%20cool%20#tag")
```

- you might also want to have a look at the urltools package for more extensive features
